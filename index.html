<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span>I want to try a variety of things here. First, centering. Here’s a bunch of text.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><span class="s2">What are your biggest concerns when it comes to space weather? </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p7"><span class="s2">Our inability to forecast when another such storm might hit, the extent of the global technology damage that it might cause, and the time for society to recover are my biggest concerns.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s2">Severe space weather storms of the strength of the 1859 Carrington event are rare – by analyzing the molecules deposited on ice at the poles, we can look back to about 1600 and see evidence of space weather storms as well as their strength. During that span of nearly 400 years, only the Carrington event was of the magnitude that caused the global issues back in 1859. Smaller storms occur often, but the stronger ones typically occur in conjunction with the 11 year solar sunspot cycle. With only the one data point of the 1859 Carrington space weather storm, it is difficult if not impossible to forecast when another storm of that magnitude might hit. We can say with some confidence, however, that storms of about ¼ or less of that strength occur about once every 11 years on average.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li6"><span class="s2">Are we prepared for a Carrington-level event?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p7"><span class="s2">No, but some people and infrastructure companies are becoming more knowledgeable about these storms and are starting to take some steps to protect their systems against a complete shutdown. The big problem is that, unlike 1859, people worldwide are dependent on systems that use technologies that would be effectively turn off by a severe storm if a Carrington event hit today. Everything that we use relies on technology today – not just Internet and cell phones, but power, water, gasoline for cars, banking, traffic control, and even natural gas all use technologies that need power, and it is the electric power grid that would be hit the hardest by such a storm. Of course, satellites that provide communications, GPS navigation, weather monitoring, etc. would all be at high risk during such a storm. A recent study by the National Academy of Sciences estimated that it would take the entire world up to 10 years to recover from such an event. We would instantly become agrarian again. That is a frightening vision.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
